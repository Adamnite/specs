# Adamnite Protocol Specification Version 0.1


The Adamnite Protocol Specification is a specification written by the core developers maintaining the GoAdamnite client, and is meant to act as a high-level supplement to the technical paper and other resources to aid client developers.
The specification is still a work in progress. We encourage new open source client developers to add PRs and ask for clarification in the various communication channels (Discord). 


The specification only covers the core ledger, gossip, and networking protocol. The Adamnite Virtual Machine, which determines how contracts are created and called, is not included in version 0.1. An exact description may be provided in the future. 

The specification can be found as a PDF in the specs.pdf file. Additional note-style resources, some of which do cover both the VM and the A1 programming language, can be found in the protocol research repository.
